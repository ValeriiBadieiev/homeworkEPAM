I don't know what you're looking for
You haven't found it baby, that's for sure
You rip me up, you spread me all around
In the dust of the deed of time

And this is not a case of lust, you see
It's not a matter of you versus me
It's fine the way you want me on your own
But in the end it's always me alone
